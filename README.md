# MaskRCNN_Tumor_Detection
This repository shows Colab code to perform instance segmentation for tumor in MR Images.
The repository uses Tensorflow 1.5 to fine tune a previously trained model on MS COCO data set.
## Step 1: Clone the libraries at https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN
Copy the folder mrcnn to your working directory in google drive. The data set will be automatically downloaded to the working google drive directory.
## Step 2: Now clone the colab file AIS_mask-RCNN-cell-nucleus-google-colab.ipynb
This is the code to perform instance segmentation. Make sure the paths are accurate in the Section 1.
